## App Characteristics

Vancouver CityScope is an interactive Quality of Life (QoL) visualization tool, designed to provide a rapid overview of key QoL aspects within Vancouver. It features a combined QOL index, calculated through multi-criteria decision analysis of transit accessibility, financial stress, and homeownership indices. Users can explore both the composite QoL and individual indices at census tract and dissemination area levels, offering granular insights. By having access to view every indicator individually, we can address stakeholders from various backgrounds, including policymakers, urban planners, researchers, and community advocates, each with unique interests in specific aspects of quality of life.

The app delivers an interactive, visual representation of spatial differences in financial stress, housing stability, and sustainable transportation access. This comprehensive information display allows users to identify patterns and understand the individual contributions of each indicator, alongside the overall QoL assessment, all within a single application. The user can quickly flip through the various indices and explore how the data is ditributed in space.

There is a great deal of information available all in one intuitive application. The user can select a census tract or dissemination area and the feature information widget is configured to show relevant information for each index and provide easily interpretable charts. The aim of this feature is to highlight key information about each indices, and provide users with little background on to subject to interpret the vast amounts of data being presented.

For our transit accesibility index, we can also view acessibility to public transport for every building in Vancouver. Users can either choose to explore the data on their own, or they can choose to view accessibility by either census tract or dissemination area. Users can do this by selecting a dissemination area or census tract, then clicking on 'Switch to Buildings View,' where the app is configured to zoom into that selected census tract or dissemination area. By displaying this data for every building in Vancouver, we can understand the nuances of every neighbourhood and how generalization of data can mask individual buildings taht experience poor accessibility to public transportation.
