## Mission Statement

In recent years, people around the world have had to face a global cost of living crisis, fuelled by factors such as general inflation, supply chain issues, and geopolitical instability. In 2024, Statistics Canada released a report stating that nearly half (45%) of Canadians reported that rising prices were greatly affecting their ability to meet their day-to-day expenses, 12% higher than reported two years prior in 2022 (33%)<sup>1</sup>. With increasing costs for housing, energy, groceries, and transportation, Canadians have needed to find ways to share expenses through bill splitting strategies such as taking public transportation, buying in bulk, and cohabiting with others<sup>2</sup>.

It is also important to note that rising costs tend to disproportionately impact vulnerable communities, exacerbating pre-existing problems related to housing insecurity and health inequality in lower-income populations.

The Geonas Brothers aim to enable both citizens and decision-makers to assess key indicators of quality of life across the City of Vancouver, both individually and collectively via an index.

Our project looks at spatial differences across the three categories of financial stress, housing stability, and sustainable transport methods, drawing inspiration from Canada’s Quality of Life Hub — launched by Statistics Canada in March 2022 — which brings together data for 84 indicators, spread across five domains (prosperity, health, society, environment, and good governance)<sup>3</sup>.

Our app, Vancouver CityScope, is an interactive visual information product containing a map layer with a quality of life score assessed via quality of life indicators such as income to living wage ratio, homeownership rate, housing cost burden index, and transit accessibility. We aim to empower policymakers, urban planners, researchers, and community stakeholders to explore individual indicators and make informed decisions that enhance quality of life.
